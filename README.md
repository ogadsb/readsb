# Readsb

This is a detached fork of https://github.com/Mictronics/readsb

It's main purpose is to be the backend for the global map at https://adsbexchange.com/
For that purpose it's used in conjunction with tar1090: https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090#0800-destroy-sd-card

It's continually under development, expect bugs, segfaults and all the good stuff :)

### Push server support

readsb tries to connect to a listening server, like a VRS push server.

For example feeding VRS at adsbexchange.com use the new parameters:
```
--net-connector feed.adsbexchange.com,30005,beast_out
```

### BeastReduce output

Selectively forwards beast messages if the received data hasn't been forwarded in the last 125 ms (or `--net-beast-reduce-interval`).
Data not related to the physical aircraft state are only forwarded every 500 ms (4 * `--net-beast-reduce-interval`).The messages of
this output are normal beast messages and compatible with every program able to receive beast messages.

## readsb Debian/Raspbian packages

It is designed to build as a Debian package.

## Building under jessie, stretch or buster


### Dependencies - rtlsdr

This is packaged with jessie. "sudo apt-get install librtlsdr-dev"

### Actually building it

Build package with no additional receiver library dependencies: `dpkg-buildpackage -b`.

Build with RTLSDR support: `dpkg-buildpackage -b --build-profiles=rtlsdr`

## Building manually

You can probably just run "make". By default "make" builds with no specific library support. See below.
Binaries are built in the source directory; you will need to arrange to
install them (and a method for starting them) yourself.

"make RTLSDR=yes" will enable rtl-sdr support and add the dependency on
librtlsdr.

## Configuration

After installation, either by manual building or from package, you need to configure readsb service and web application.

Edit `/etc/default/readsb` to set the service options, device type, network ports etc.

The web application is configured by editing `/usr/share/readsb/html/script/readsb/defaults.js` or `src/script/readsb/default.ts`
prior to compilation. Several settings can be modified through web browser. These settings are stored inside browser indexedDB
and are individual to users or browser profiles.

## Note about bias tee support

Bias tee support is available for RTL-SDR.com V3 dongles. If you wish to enable bias tee support,
you must ensure that you are building this package with a version of librtlsdr installed that supports this capability.
You can find suitable source packages [here](https://github.com/librtlsdr/librtlsdr). To enable the necessary
support code when building, be sure to include preprocessor define macro HAVE_BIASTEE, e.g.:

"make HAVE_BIASTEE=yes" will enable biastee support for RTLSDR interfaces.
